
Note: If you're having trouble with a new version, try deleting '.build' dirs!!!!!

***** V30 *****

Rebuilt trans_macos to work on 32 bit Mac CPUs.

Changed trans stdcpp target to produce -arch i386 targets only for now.

Fixed dodgy preprocessor error reporing.

Began work on XNA Windows Phone 7 support.

Enabled 'Reach' in XNA - XNA apps should work on wider range of HW.

Fixed Consts in funcs crashing compiler.

Fixed ToArray methods in std.stack

Fixed astranslator crashing when generating return stmt for abstract void methods.


***** V29 *****

Release build!


***** V28 *****

Misc...


***** V27 *****

Monk now only requests build target first time build/run is used - select plain 'build' to change target.

More docs, samples, tutorials etc.


***** V26 *****

Added math.Log()

Fixed C# Ceil()


***** V25 *****

It's all a blur...I can't remember...sanity check version release!


***** V24 *****

Experimental: Added a top level mojo module that imports all mojo.* modules for you.

Experimental: Added a top level monkey module that imports all monkey.* modules for you - this is imported by default.

Experimental: 'std' module is now 'monkey'.

Renamed List/Vector.Remove to RemoveEach

Removed 'Module', 'Emit'

Added current dir relative imports - tweaked import/module system.


***** V23 *****

Added .xml and .json as valid text file types.

Fixed monk for new error formatting.

Change error format to:      FILE<LINE> : Error : Blah etc

Added error for accessing field from another field - sorry folks, but as/xna don't approve! Might look into this again one day though.

Fixed LoadString with files in subdirs.

Added enquoting of '\' for data strings.

Fixed boxing/unboxing weirdness causing strange 'method new not found' errors.


***** V22 *****

Added identifier not found case hints.

Fixed duplicate method/functions not being detected (overload resolve logic was just taking the first match!)

Fixed loose array casts.

Added "ElseIf" to go with "EndIf"

Addde support for End [If], End [While] and End [Next].

Print is now a 'normal' statement.

Break gone for good - renamed to Exit.

Fixed Android invalid DeviceWidth/DeviceHeight in OnCreate.

Adding checking for non-ident file names.

Fixed 'missing return' with no err info.

Added -cfgfile= option to trans for multiple config file support. Config files should still be in the same dir as trans.

Changed trans so text files are loaded/saved in binary fopen mode instead of text. This means no more conversion of EOLs, so text files should contain exactly the same chars regardless of platform. text mode had been converting \r\n to \n on Windows but not on Mac, leading to potential Mac only issues.

Fixed 'string too long' MSVC error with big text files.


***** V21 *****

Module reference is now Chrome friendly.

iPhone Simulator now killed each time before launch, for more reliable app updates. A bit experimental!

You can now use ${BLAH} to insert env vars into config file paths.

Added support for non-local index vars in for loops - please test!

Cleaned up GLFW a bit - fixed weird chars in title bar in release mode, and added defines at top of main.cpp for easier display config.


***** V20 *****

George now generates search index - nice!

Clean up glfw input handling a bit and added some CHAR defines for converting 'unprintable' keys to chars for GetChar. Please use CHAR_ETC consts for now - the <32 ones will probably stay, but the others may change.

Monk uses trans valid targets info to fill in its target combo box.

trans with no args now dumps 'valid targets' info, deduced from config file paths. Not foolproof though!

More error handling and even requesters on some targets - ooeer!


***** V19 *****

Added more errror handling in general.

Added 'Function Error( msg$ )' - can be used to 'quit' a program with a Null 'msg'.


***** V18 *****

SetColor back to 0-255.

Removed std.color, std.rect - too contentious!


***** V17 *****

Unified GLFW/iOS mojo OpenGL code.

Improved unreachable code detection, for the love of Java what a PITA!

Added 'Shl' and 'Shr'. 'Shr' is signed, no unsigned op: use '&' masking if necessary.

'trans' and 'scandir' tools moved to 'bin' dir. 'scandir' renamed to 'makemeta'.

Changed 'Break' to 'Exit' - will recognize both until next release!

Added a bunch of mojo graphics 'get' functions.

Added std.rect and std.color modules and added mojo support - SetColor now takes 0-1!

***** V15 *****

Fixed skid's const bool eval bug.

Fixed glfw minimize window bug.

Fixed html5 lost mouseup event by simulating mouseup when mouse leaves canvas - not ideal, any better ideas most welcome.

Added SetBlend to mojo.graphics: 0 for normal/alpha, 1 for 'lighten' - exact algorithm is target dependent! Lighten is slow on Android!

Added SetAlpha to mojo.graphics: affects images too.

Added SetScissor to mojo.graphics - works in untransformed device coords.


***** V14 *****

Added private imports.

Added -update, -build to trans.

Added GC to glfw/ios targets.

MilliSecs renamed to Millisecs.

gxtk renamed to mojo.

***** V13 *****

Added LoadString/SaveString functions to gxtp.app

Added '-config=' option to trans - options are debug or release. Doesn't do much/anything yet!

Added '-clean' option to trans for deleting target build dir (used to always do this).

Resurrected 'Strict' mode!

Added 'strict', 'void' to keywords in toker.


***** V12 *****

SetFont/DrawText added. These are very simple and meant mainly for debugging purposes.

String imports can now only be used to import non-monkey files.

Lazy import support added.

Added simple preprocessor: Uses '#' at start of line ala C.

Directives are:

#If <expression>
#Else
#Else If
#End
#Print <expression>
#Rem   (same as #If 0)

Only SIMPLE expressions supported!

The following predefined string consts can be used:

HOST		'One of: winnt macos linux
LANG		'One of: js as cs java cpp
TARGET		'One of: html5 flash xna android iphone 
MODPATH		'modules dir
PROJPATH	'top dir of project being compiled

macos should be darwin?

#Rem
------------------
This is a comment!
------------------
#End

Added App.MilliSecs() - milliseconds since app started.

Added List.Remove( value:T ) - remove ALL instances of a value.


***** V7 *****

Added Resize( length ) method to arrays.

Slice indices now clamped to string/array length - see new Resize() for resizing arrays.

Slices: negative 'from' or 'to' params indicate distance from end of string/array.

Started some docs - see docs.txt in std and gxtk dirs.

Renamed sqr -> sqrt.
